# yareli-discord
Yareli is a discord bot which simplifies interaction with Warframe in Discord. 
I wrote her specially for my friend's clan. However she is usable for other clans, but you need to host her.

## Features
- Notify about in-game events
  - Remind about events starting in X minutes
  - Remind about events ending in X minutes (e.g cetus nights ends in 10 minutes)
  - Subscribe to event
- Basic server management
  - Channel control

## Getting started
